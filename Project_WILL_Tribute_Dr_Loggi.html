    <h1>Project W.I.L.L.</h1>
    <p><strong>A Tribute to Dr. Daniel G. Loggi Sr.</strong></p>

    <p>In the late 1960s, Atlantic City embarked on an educational journey that was well ahead of its time. Project W.I.L.L. (an acronym believed to reflect "Workshops for Interracial Learning and Leadership") was a bold and visionary initiative aimed at voluntary racial and socioeconomic integration during a period of immense national tension. The project used federal Title I education funds to bring together diverse groups of students for a shared academic and social experience — not in a traditional school setting, but in a historic Atlantic City hotel: the Traymore.</p>

    <p>At the center of this groundbreaking effort stood Dr. Daniel G. Loggi Sr., a man whose leadership, communication skills, and unwavering belief in the transformative power of education made the project possible. Dr. Loggi personally secured the federal funding that would breathe life into Project W.I.L.L. — an unprecedented move at the time. He worked directly with the Department of Education to bring national attention and federal support to the Atlantic City School District, helping shape an initiative that offered students a chance to learn, grow, and lead in ways that traditional schools simply could not offer.</p>

    <p>Project W.I.L.L. provided a unique environment where students lived and learned together at the Traymore Hotel, participating in leadership programs, cultural workshops, and academic intensives that forged bonds across racial lines and instilled a deep sense of civic responsibility. It became one of the rare examples of voluntary integration that succeeded through innovation, compassion, and fearless execution.</p>

    <h2>Dr. Loggi’s Legacy</h2>
    <p>Dr. Loggi’s legacy extends far beyond a single project. Over the following decades, he served the Atlantic City School District with distinction, including as Business Administrator, Board Secretary, Interim Superintendent, and later, Interim Business Administrator. In each role, he brought a steady hand and forward-thinking vision — always advocating for student-centered reforms and fiscal responsibility.</p>

    <p>But perhaps what defines his legacy best is the profound respect he earned from educators, students, and community leaders alike — not just for what he accomplished, but for how he led. With clarity. With grace. And always with the belief that public education could be a force for real, lasting change.</p>
